Quantifying the UK economic contribution of the mathematical sciences in 2023 (and beyond)


## Background
In a 2024 report, the Academy for the Mathematical Sciences (AcadMathSci) estimated that 4.2 million people were directly employed in mathematical science occupations, directly adding some Â£490 bn in gross value (20% of total GVA) to the UK's economy in 2023. This repository contains all the code used to perform the analysis leading to those estimates.
